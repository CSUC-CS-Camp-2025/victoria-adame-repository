    <p>
      Mexico is officially known as the United Mexican States. It is a country in North America that borders the United States of America.
      <br> Mexico is one of the most popular vacation spots. It is also known for its incredible food and culture. Some people see Mexico as
      <br> a dangerous place (which it can be) but to me it has always been like a home. Both of my Parents immigrated from Mexico to the U.S.A.
      <br>So I was brought up constantly going to Mexico. It has always been my favorite place to be. I love it so much because of my family,the ocean
      <br>and the enviroment. All of my fondest memories are in mexico.The beaches are amazing the are tons of them so you can pick and choose one 
      <br> you like. My favorite beach has to be Playa El Puerto. It has amazing big waves so you're always having fun, you can fish, whale watch, and 
      <br> enjoy some amazing food. But enough about me lets learn some history. Guerrero, Mexico has a rich and divurse culture. it is deeply rooted in its 
      <br>indigenous heritage and shaped by its unique geography and history. Guerrero is home to several indigenous groups, including the Nahua, Mixtec, Tlapanec, and Amuzgo
      <br>even though Mexico's offical language is Spanish several indigenous languages like Nahuatl, Mixtec, Tlapaneco, and Amuzgo are still spoken.
      <br>These languages are often intertwined with traditional practices, rituals, and beliefs. A lot of Guerrero's communities practice a form of Catholicism. 
      <br> They have blended the religion with indigenous beliefs and reverence for ancestors and spirits. Guerrero is also famous for thier arts and crafts.
      <br> it refelcts the diverse skills and traditions of its indigenous groups.
